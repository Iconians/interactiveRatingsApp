# Interactive Rating App

## Tech I built this App with

React, TypeScript, CSS and Vite

## Challenges

I had a few challenges though it was to do with styling as I was trying to emulate the example perfectly which until I downloaded the figma file was proving difficult.
the biggest issue I had was recreating the background which had a bit of of a gradient, when I saw how it was done in the figma file and a little help from the ai
I got pretty close. then from there I was able to recreate the other colors to a pretty close approximation of what was presented in the figma file

I haven't hosted this app and most likely wont as its really simple and not much to it.
